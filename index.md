# Exploring Themes with Topic Modeling
(in development)

**Exploring Themes with Topic Modeling belongs to a series of workshops on computational text analysis.**

When working with texts at scale, we may wish to generalize the "about-ness" of the corpus without having to read through each document. Computational methods can allow us to quickly explore relationships between frequently used words and make inferences about themes from the results returned.

Topic modeling is a natural language processing technique that groups words in “topics” based on the frequency of their appearance near each other in a text. It can be used to interpret thematic trends within a large body of text. In this module, we will introduce topic modeling using three different computational approaches.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the lesson, learners will be able to:

* Define topic modeling
* Use at least one tool to perform topic modeling on a text corpus 
* Explain the limitations of topic modeling
