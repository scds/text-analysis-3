# Topic Modeling with Python (Gensim & SpaCy)

Our third approach to topic modeling uses the Python programming language. The lesson that follows uses the open source integrated development environment (IDE) Spyder, which is bundled in with Anaconda data science platform that you were encouraged to download at the beginning of the lesson. If you are new to programming (and perhaps not to keen to learn), you may alternatvely wish to use the [Jupyter notebook instance of the script](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1biLTOz5Va-824g7o94Le9QIRM0jxx2ty?usp=sharing). Instructions on how to run the script are included in the notebook, and there is a [video recording of how to use the script](https://echo360.ca/media/12af901f-4582-4b13-92c5-6e7915e99dcd/public?startTimeMillis=7706430) from a previous workshop (topic modeling script starts around 2:08:15); the videos and screenshots below demonstrate the Spyder IDE workflow.   

You can compare the results that you get from running the script in Jupyter Notebooks on your corpus subset with your results from MALLET and Voyant. If you get the richest and most coherent topics in Python, that is the tool you will want to work with for you full corpus. You may even wish to compare results between Jupyter Notebooks and the Spyder IDE, as outlined below.

1. Install the required packages
2. Import internal and external libraries (i.e. dependencies)
3. Read the files containing the text data
4. Identify stopwords for the corpus
5. Tokenize and lemmatize text data, and remove stopwords
6. Preprocess texts using the Gensim library
7. Create a dictionary of words used in the corpus
8. Retrieve words from corpus dictionary
9. Create topics in Gensim
10. Create topic modeling visualization with LDAvis
