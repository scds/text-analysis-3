# What is Topic Modeling?

In a digital scholarship context, topic modeling is typically used to get a sense of what a document, set of documents (corpus) or subset of documents is broadly about. “Documents” here could be articles, archives, web pages, tweets, transcripts of interviews and so on. 

You may have used term frequencies - that is, counting how many times a specific word or words appear in a corpus - for the same reasons. For example, in a political party's platform, the frequent appearance of words like "climate," "green" and "environment" may allow you to conclude that climate action is one of their priorities. However, while we humans can infer from , the semantic. In a way, we are creating topic models  term frequencies can be . ; give example - board: a Board of Directors? To board a vessel? A board of wood, etc. 

Topic modeling adds nuance by grouping terms (words) that appear in the text together to a greater degree than others; in a way, topic modeling creates a context in which to understand the term(s). Or, put another way:

“A topic can be thought of as the cluster of words that tend to come up in a discussion and therefore to co-occur more frequently than they otherwise would, whenever the topic is being discussed.” (Ignatow & Mihalcea, 2)

It may be clear from describing how topic modeling is undertaken that it would be difficult if not impossible to perform on texts at scale without computational means. At the same time, there are evident trade-offs in automating tasks through the use of general rules: words in a related topic may be split between segments and so, appear less related.

## On the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm

Many topic modeling approaches rely on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm, though it is not the only algorithm used to perform topic modeling (see also.


Topic modeling can be an elusive concept to grasp relative to other text analysis techniques like named entity recognition or part-of-speech (POS) tagging. If it is still a bit hazy, you may find it helpful to actually go through the process.
