# Topic Modeling with MALLET

## About MALLET

MALLET, or **MA**chine **L**earning for **L**anguag**E** **T**oolkit, is an open-source, Java-based package for performing machine learning tasks on texts such as information extraction or topic modeling. It is widely used in the academic Digital Scholarship community, and there is a [spectacular lesson on topic modeling with MALLET](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet) created by Graham, Weinhart and Milligan on the [Programming Historian website](https://programminghistorian.org/).

If you would prefer to not use a programmming language like Python to perform topic modelling, MALLET is a robust and easy-to-use command line tool that comes with a pre-trained model. You may find MALLET adequate for your purposes and decide not to go any further in the workshop.

Below, we have created a video that takes you through the steps of the lesson created by Graham et al. on a Mac OS. On Windows, the commands vary slightly; we will note in the video where there are differences.

You can also simply go directly to the lesson on the Programming Historian if you prefer a static set of instructions with screenshots to video.
