# Topic Modelling with MALLET

## About MALLET

MALLET, or **MA**chine **L**earning for **L**anguag**E** **T**oolkit, is an open-source, Java-based package for performing machine learning tasks on texts such as information extraction or topic modelling. It is widely used in the academic Digital Scholarship community, and there is a [spectacular lesson on topic modelling with MALLET](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet) created by Graham, Weinhart and Milligan on the [Programming Historian website](https://programminghistorian.org/).

If you would prefer to not use a programmming language like Python or R to perform topic modelling, MALLET is a robust and easy-to-use command line tool that comes with a pre-trained model. You may find MALLET adequate for your purposes and decide not to go any further in the workshop.

Below, we have created videos that take you through the steps of the lesson created by Graham et al. on both a Mac and Windows machine, respectively (as they are slightly different). You can simply go directly to the lesson on the Programming Historian if you prefer a static set of instructions with screenshots to video.
