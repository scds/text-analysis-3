# Topic Modeling

## Lesson Roadmap

1. What is Topic Modeling?
2. Topic Modeling with Voyant Tools
3. Topic Modeling with MALLET
4. Topic Modeling with Python (Gensim and SpaCy)

<hr />

## Lesson Format

The hands-on components of the lesson are available as videos with written instructions and screenshots of the video content below. If you are newer to programming, you are encouraged to watch the videos and use the written sections for later reference but feel free to approach the lesson however you prefer!

Note: screenshots are taken on a Windows OS while the video is filmed on a Mac to provide most of our learners with recognizable examples (with apologies to Linux users for leaving Linux out!).

## Lesson Prerequisites

While a familiarity with basic programming concepts - such as variables, comments and the importance of correct syntax - will be an asset in completing the lesson, the videos explain the code in greater depth if you are newer to programming or a bit rusty. If you have programming experience, you will be able to move through the lesson quite quickly - you may wish to go directly to the [finished Python script](https://github.com/scds/text-analysis-3/blob/main/assets/topic-model.py).
