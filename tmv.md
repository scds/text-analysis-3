# Topic Modeling with Voyant Tools

Voyant Tools is a visual text analysis environment designed by (and for!) digital humanists. It is a feature-rich yet accessible tool for creating a range of helpful visualizations. Later in the lesson, we will use the Python programming language to do topic modeling - although such an approach offers a greater number of parameters to experiment with, it can also require a greater level of comfort with writing code to troubleshoot errors. Voyant has a graphical interface, and - in addition to modeling topics - can map text data to scatterplots, network graphs, stream graphs and more.

You might find that Voyant Tools is entirely sufficient for your purposes. In which case, you can forego the rest of the lesson - but you may also want to try the other methods out for comparison sake, even if they require an increasing degree of comfort with programming concepts and the command line interface. Working with practical and meaningful examples is a great way to learn those skills!


## Voyant Tools - Server Version

Voyant Tools has a downloadable version of the application available in the form [Voyant Server](https://github.com/voyanttools/VoyantServer/releases/tag/2.6.5). Voyant Server can be run from your computer without an Internet connection, and accessed via your web browser.

Using Voyant Server is the preferred approach if you will be working with very large corpora or if you are working with documents that should not be publically accessible due to privacy or copyright concerns. One drawback of Voyant Server, however, is that it relies on a very narrow window of Java versions - between Java 8 and Java 11.

If you have Java 8, 9, 10 or 11 installed on your computer, Voyant Server will be relatively easy to use. Otherwise, you may need to run multiple versions of Java on your machine - which is doable! - but more involved. Refer to instructions on running multiple versions of Java [in Windows (Sven Woltmann)](https://www.happycoders.eu/java/how-to-switch-multiple-java-versions-windows/) or [on Mac (Jayson Minard on StackOverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52524112/how-do-i-install-java-on-mac-osx-allowing-version-switching/52524114#52524114).
