# Topic Modeling with Voyant Tools

Voyant Tools is a visual text analysis environment designed by (and for!) digital humanists. It is a feature-rich yet accessible tool for creating a range of helpful visualizations. Later in the lesson, we will use the Python programming language to do topic modeling - although such an approach offers a greater number of parameters to experiment with, it can also require a greater level of comfort with writing code to troubleshoot errors. Voyant has a graphical interface, and - in addition to modeling topics - can map text data to scatterplots, network graphs, stream graphs and more.
