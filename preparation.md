# Workshop Preparation 

Preparation for this tutorial consists of two steps: [Getting the data](#get-the-data) and [Getting the software](#get-the-software). Please follow the steps below before beginning the lesson.

## Get the data

The corpus we will be working with in the 

## Get the software

This hands-on workshop uses several tools / programming languages to perform topic modelling: MALLET, Python and R. You do not have to use all of them, but the intent is for you to get a sense of each with a small sample from your own corpus so that you can choose an approach that works best for you.

## Assemble your own corpus (optional)

In advance of the lesson, we also recommend that you assemble a collection of documents to work with for the *Try it with your data* sections. We will use the texts provided above to practice the techniques demonstrated in the lesson but each dataset brings its own unique features. Even if you are not going through the lesson with a specific project in mind, having a different corpus to experiment with will help to reinforce the concepts and enrich your knowledge of the topic.

If you have not already gone through your corpus to get a sense of what errors it might contain, now is a good time! If key words are misspelled, they may not be emerge as relevant themes through topic modelling.
